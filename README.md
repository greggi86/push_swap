The push_swap Project

Sorting with Regulated Operations

The push_swap project at 42 University presents a unique challenge in the realm of sorting algorithms.
Unlike traditional sorting techniques, this project requires you to sort a set of numbers using a highly regulated set of operations,
testing your problem-solving skills and your ability to optimize your code.The core of the push_swap project is the management of two stacks, named a and b.
At the beginning, the stack a contains a random assortment of unique negative and/or positive numbers, while the stack b is initially empty.
Your goal is to sort the numbers in a in ascending order using a series of predefined operations, such as swapping, pushing, and rotating the elements in the stacks.
The challenge lies in the fact that you are limited to a specific set of 11 operations, each with its own unique purpose and effect on the stacks.
You must carefully choose and sequence these operations to efficiently sort the numbers, minimizing the total number of moves required.
As you work on the push_swap project, you will delve into the intricacies of stack manipulation, algorithm design, and optimization techniques.
You will need to analyze the structure of the input, identify patterns, and develop strategies to sort the numbers using the limited set of operations at your disposal.
The successful completion of the push_swap project demonstrates your ability to think creatively, problem-solve, and implement complex algorithms in C.
It showcases your understanding of data structures, control flow, and the optimization of code performance, all within the constraints of a unique sorting problem.
This project not only tests your technical skills but also challenges you to think outside the box, fostering your growth as a problem-solver and a proficient C programmer.
The lessons learned here will undoubtedly serve you well as you continue your journey at 42 University and beyond.
